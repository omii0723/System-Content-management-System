# Contact Management System

## Description

This Contact Management System is a simple command-line application that allows users to store, manage, and manipulate contact information. Users can add new contacts, view the list of contacts, edit existing contacts, and delete contacts as needed. The contact information is stored in a JSON file to ensure that data is persisted between sessions.

## Features

- **Add New Contact**: Enter and save a contact's name, phone number, and email address.
- **View All Contacts**: Display a list of all saved contacts with their details.
- **Edit Contact**: Modify the information of an existing contact.
- **Delete Contact**: Remove a contact from the contact list.
- **Persistent Storage**: Contacts are saved in a JSON file (`contacts.json`), ensuring they are available even after the program is closed.

## How It Works

1. **File Storage**:
   - Contacts are stored in a JSON file named `contacts.json`.
   - The file is automatically created if it doesn't exist when the program starts.

2. **Main Menu**:
   - When the program is run, a main menu is displayed with options to add, view, edit, or delete contacts, or exit the program.

3. **Adding Contacts**:
   - The user is prompted to enter a name, phone number, and email address.
   - The contact is then added to the contact list and saved in the JSON file.

4. **Viewing Contacts**:
   - The program lists all contacts in the order they were added, displaying their name, phone number, and email address.

5. **Editing Contacts**:
   - The user can select a contact by its index number from the list and update any of the details.

6. **Deleting Contacts**:
   - The user can remove a contact from the list by selecting its index number.

7. **Exiting the Program**:
   - The user can exit the program, and all contact data is saved for future sessions.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x

## Usage

### Running the Program

1. Clone or download the script.
2. Ensure you have Python installed on your machine.
3. Run the script using a Python interpreter:

   ```bash
   python contact_management_system.py
   ```

4. The main menu will appear, where you can choose options to manage your contacts.

### Example

When you run the program, you will see a menu like this:

```bash
Contact Management System
1. Add New Contact
2. View All Contacts
3. Edit Contact
4. Delete Contact
5. Exit
```

- Choose an option by entering the corresponding number.
- Follow the prompts to add, view, edit, or delete contacts.

## Data Storage

- Contacts are stored in `contacts.json`.
- If the file doesn't exist, it will be created automatically when the program runs.

## Error Handling

- The program assumes valid input for most actions. Future improvements could include more robust input validation.
